# Flask Web App
This is a simple Flask web application that displays information on the AWS EC2 server. Note this app must be running on an AWS EC2 server.

## Getting Started
To run the app, you must have Python 3.x and the Flask library installed on your system. You can install Flask using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

Once you have installed Flask, you can run the app using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask development server, and the app will be accessible in your web browser at http://<domain>:8080/.

## Checking the Result
If the app runs correctly, you should see a web page displayed in your web browser.
